        <p>I'm a big enthusiast of building <strong>maintainable</strong> and <strong>scalable</strong> front-ends. To achieve this goal, I <strong>build</strong> frameworks mostly powered with Sass, PHP and love. I <strong>maintain</strong> open-source projects such as <a href="https://github.com/bcinarli/caffeine" target="_blank" title="Sass based Mixin and Functions library">Caffeine</a>, <a href="https://github.com/bcinarli/melange" target="_blank" title="A maintainable CSS architecture approach">Melange</a>, <a href="https://github.com/bcinarli/misto" target="_blank" title="A PHP based prototyping and blogging framework">Misto</a> and <a href="https://github.com/uxrocket" target="_blank" title="A set of jQuery plugins and JavaScript methods for interactive sites">UX Rocket</a></p>
        
        <p>In day-to-day works, I code <strong>mobile web apps</strong> and <strong>JavaScript applications</strong> for intranets and as well as clients. I <strong>manage</strong> teams and <strong>optimize</strong> the front-end development approaches through different development teams. Also, I <strong>teach</strong> HTML/CSS and JavaScript techniques and gave workshops about Front-end related topics.</p>

        <p>I <strong>blog</strong> at <a href="http://htmlmag.com">HTML Mag</a> and share my thoughts about web development, mobile approaches. In HTML Mag, we organize events, talks, workshops...</p>
