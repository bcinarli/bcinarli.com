  "I'm a big enthusiast of building <strong>maintainable</strong> and <strong>scalable</strong> front-ends. To achieve this goal, I <strong>build</strong> frameworks mostly powered with Sass, PHP and love. I <strong>maintain</strong> open-source projects such as <a href=\"https://github.com/bcinarli/caffeine\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Sass based Mixin and Functions library\">Caffeine</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/bcinarli/melange\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"A maintainable CSS architecture approach\">Melange</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/bcinarli/misto\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"A PHP based prototyping and blogging framework\">Misto</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/uxrocket\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"A set of JavaScript components for interactive sites\">UX Rocket</a>",
  "In day-to-day works, I code <strong>mobile web apps</strong> and <strong>JavaScript applications</strong> for intranets and as well as clients. I <strong>manage</strong> teams and <strong>optimize</strong> the front-end development approaches through different development teams. Also, I <strong>teach</strong> HTML/CSS and JavaScript techniques and gave workshops about Front-end related topics.",
  "I <strong>blog</strong> at <a href=\"http://htmlmag.com\">HTML Mag</a> and share my thoughts about web development, mobile approaches. In HTML Mag, we organize events, talks, workshops..."
